# Wifi-speedtest-GUI-Application
In this project i have created an **internet speed testing application** which can **notify about the download speed, upload speed, and also the ping** which is the reaction time of the connection.
The application will also detect whether or not the system is connected to internet connection and can notify about it.

## Application Demo
